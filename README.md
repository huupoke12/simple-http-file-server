# Introduction

This is a simple HTTP file server in Python, with HTML GUI that can be used to upload files from the browser.

Run `python3 main.py` to use it. Or you can just click on it if you have Python file association.

**WARNING**: This is just a simple file server, designed to be portable in one file, used for simple file sharing between LAN clients. It does not have any security protection. It can potentially overload your system's memory. Do not expose this server on the Internet or any untrusted networks.

# Options
Just run it with `-h` for option documentation. The current directory is used as the starting directory.
